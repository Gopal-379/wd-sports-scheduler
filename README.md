# This is NodeJS Application
A sports scheduler is a useful resource designed to aid in the planning and coordination of sports events or tournaments. It facilitates the arrangement of dates, times, venues, and teams for each game or match. Additionally, certain sports schedulers provide features for tracking scores, standings, playoffs, and other pertinent information associated with your chosen sport.
